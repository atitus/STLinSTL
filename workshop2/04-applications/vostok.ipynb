    "From a deep ice core sampled in Antarctica, surface temperature, carbon dioxide, and dust could be measured as a function of time in the past. While other measurements were made as well (see the above reference), we will look at temperature and carbon dioxide. This [data set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atitus/STLinSTL/main/workshop2/04-applications/vostok.txt) includes the columns:\n",
