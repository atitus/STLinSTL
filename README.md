# STLinSTL

Workshops for the [STLinSTL](http://stlinstl.org/) conference.

## Workshop 1 - Integrating computational modeling into applied math and science

### Description

Modeling is a significant component of contemporary applied math and science. Computers allow students to model complex phenomena, explore relationships, and make predictions with no previous coding experience. Integrating computational modeling with the traditional algebraic (i.e. analytic) curriculum - of which we are already quite familiar - allows students to explore more complex and relevant problems without sacrificing the traditional learning objectives.  **In this hands-on workshop, you will use Python to explore system dynamics models in math and science, including the spread of infectious disease, financial forecasting, climate models, and others. No previous coding experience is required.**

## Workshop 2: Data-driven modeling in applied math and science

### Description

We have moved from the information age into the data analytics age. Data-driven modeling (or empirical modeling) is describing a system through curve fitting and general data analysis. There may or may not be a theoretical description of the system, and the model is based solely on measurement and observation. Curve-fitting gives a mathematical description (i.e. "the model") and can be used to make predictions. In this hands-on workshop, you will use Python to fit curves to experimental or observational data in a breadth of applications including allometry (e.g. growth of organisms) and model rockets, for example. With no previous coding required, this can be a gentle introduction to coding and its application in data science. Although a spreadsheet is useful for linear trendlines and a few other functions, it does not scale to general data-driven modeling.
